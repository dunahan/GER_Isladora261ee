INTRODUCTION

From the same fools who brought you PHB Familiars and UMD by the book, Supply Based
Resting, Party Loot Notification, Permanent Area Effect Spells, Speed Override,
Take Cover (PHB environment AC), PHB Movement Skills (Balance, Climb, Jump,
Swim, Escape Artist), and Player Character Auto Save.

The main intent of this system is that players never instantly die (configurable). Player death
will always be caused by player action -- because help didn't reach them in time
and never because of a bad roll of the dice. They will always go through bleeding
before reaching death. There are stabilization checks (configurable 10% chance)
and bandages can bring you back to life on a DC 15 heal skill check as per PHB,
except that when stabilized you instantly go to 1 HP.

One of the unfortunate side effect of playing a real-time game rather than a
turn-based game is that it can be very difficult to react to a player bleeding
in a timely matter. In turn-based play, your party members would know that you
are bleeding and be able to react within one or two round. This system seeks to
restore the ability for your party members to be aware and react.

With the default settings of this system it should be very rare for low level
players to die if they have party members with them for support. Once they reach
higher levels and have the means to afford Resurrection and Raise Dead then the
time to bleed to death decreases. The intention is to make death a rare
occurrence. After all, with all those local clerics tossing out rez like candy,
its any wonder there's still undead around left to fight.

The bleed/death system is intended for multiplayer use but CAN be used in solo
play. The respawn system is intended for multiplayer use only but can be used
for single party if the auto-raise feature is enabled. The auto-raise feature
can be configured to use up scrolls. The respawn system can be disabled or
easily replaced with a different system.

This system was originally built with single-party DMed play in mind, but it
should be able to scale to ANY kind of play. This is the Swiss Army knife of
death systems. The same bleeding/death/respawn system can be used for henchmen
AS WELL as players, removing additional complexity from your module.

If you want to support solo play with this script, then enable the fast
bleed option and set the solo auto-raise option to a very low value. That way
when a player bleeds/dies in solo play they do not have to wait long for help
that will never come.

Finally, the system can be configured in a short time to fit your needs.
Respawned PCs can be moved to a predefined waypoint, you can also use the
bindstone system implemented. HPs can be fully managed by the HABD. Finally you
have some tools to use some sort of 'Hell/Heaven' areas in your module.

THANKS
- HCR team, at one time or another we must have stolen some of your ideas.
- Lazybones for coming up with a name for the system.
- Typhonius, DickNervous, Feds, Ochobee and Blewz for help with the initial play-testing.
- Giantkin for help with betatesting.

Apologies to anyone who is suffering, or knows someone who suffers with a
hereditary blood-coagulation disorder and takes offense at the name. We thought
it was a rather witty name for a system where players must always go through
bleeding before dying. No offense was intended.

FEATURES

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

- Basics: 5 scripts, 3 player items, 2 DM items, 1 placeable. Some optional
premade objects (2NPC, 3 Conversations, 1 Placeable, 1 Waypoint, 1 Trigger).
The only NWN content modified is Raise Dead and Resurrection
spells, and the henchmen death scripts should be modified if you want to enable
henchman bleeding/respawn as ghost.
- It uses DelayCommand events scheduled on the players instead of heartbeats.
It only uses CPU cycles when players are bleeding, dying, dead, respawned or
entering/leaving the module. This removes the overhead of searching through the
player list on the heartbeat.
- Delayed commands are rescheduled at the start of a chain to prevent stalled
states when the CPU is overloaded and events start getting dropped.
- DelayCommand is *NOT* a recursive function, so there is no worry about CPU
performance hits.
- All settings are CONST variables that are evaluated at compile time to speed up execution.
- Henchmen only bleed/respawn if they have a master. Potions can be used on
bleeding henchmen as well as any of the normal means of healing another creature.
Henchmen bleeding is implemented by "faking" to 0 to -9 HP bleed with 10 to 0 HP.
FEATURES NOT IMPLEMENTED
- We considered having an option for limiting raising and resurrecting to same
party only (to prevent death penalty griefers) but you cannot invite dead players
to your party so we decided against that.
- We considered storing player location persistently, but all persistent location
systems I have seen require some kind of workaround to store the player location
over a module reset (most common being an additional script in the exit event of
every area). We figured it was better to leave such complexity out of this system
and let the end user choose the persistent location system that is right for their
needs. HOWEVER see the BindStone feature.
- We include an optional kind of bind stone system. It can be also used to bring
persistence to controled locations.
- Our respawn system can easily be removed (changing one line in the configuration) so that you can
replace it with the respawn system of your choice.
- Dropped items are not automatically picked up. Dropping large inventories is
laggy enough without adding additional processing.
- There is no ability to change the settings while the module is running. This
is because all the settings are constants to speed up execution.
- It is not possible to make familiars or animal companions bleed because there
is no scripting command for making them rejoin the party as a familiar/companion.
ITEMS:
- All items are stored under Custom4 in the palette or Chooser. (creatures at
tutorial)
- Automatically given out to players who do not possess them on log in.
- All items have no weight, are worth no money and cannot be sold.
- Items cannot be transferred to other players or dropped.
- There is a Skull item that displays the player's bleed/death/lost XP/lost GP
statistics.
- There is a Bandages item that can stabilize a bleeding player on a DC 15 heal
check or make a respawned ghost follow the player using the bandages.
    (there are advanced bandages that can be sold, are not free, and could be
    placed at stores if you wish).
- There is a Rulebook item that displays how this system is configured for the
module. It displays the penalties as they would currently apply to the PC reading the book.
- There is a DM statistic item that can display the bleed/death/lost XP/lost GP
statistics for an entire party.
- There is a DM force death item that can instant kill players/henchmen without
putting them through the bleeding state. You can tie this in with the prevent
death feature to make death only happen when the DM decides it should.

BLEEDING:
- Works for players as well as henchmen.
- 10% chance of self-stabilization to 1 HP (chance is configurable)
- If going from living to -6 or lower you will be capped at -5 to give you a
good chance to be saved (configurable).
- If going from living to dead you will be set to -6 to -9 HP instead of dying
 (configurable).
- You can declare some areas where death is hard: Mosters will be able to kill you
on a single hit, and you will start bleeding at appropiate number (no -5 limit)
- Free DC15 heal check bandages can be used to stabilize other players to 1 HP.
- Any healing will stabilize another player.
- Casting raise/rez on a bleeding player stabilizes them to 1 HP or more. (It is
a waste of a spell, but it works).
- Immune to damage while bleeding. You have to bleed to death.
- Regeneration items always stabilize players and keep them from ever dying.
(Defaults to leaving regeneration items on the player) It can unequip these items.
- Bleeding players are temporarily made invisible to make monsters change targets.
- Players can be made invisible for a configurable amount of time after bleeding
to give them a chance to heal or run away (default is 1 second).
- Possessed familiars die instead of bleeding.
- First bleed message tells the total time until death.
- Nearby party members are notified of the bleeding player every round, even
number of rounds between bleeding is greater than one.
- All DMs are notified of when players are bleeding/dying. (default on)
- Number of rounds between bleeding is based off of player level. (defaults to
giving low levels a long time between bleeding to reduce the chance of dying
since they can't afford Raise/Rez)
- Fast 1sec bleed when playing solo without a party (configurable). (default off)
- There is an option for preventing player death until they reach a certain
level. (default is 2). The DM Force Instant Death widget can bypass this setting.

DEATH:
- Now you can specify areas (by Resref) where death and bleeding is imposible.
- Now you can specify areas (by Resref) where Instant Death due to a single hit
is allowed.
- Force auto-respawn after being dead for a specified time. (default 3 min)
- Force auto-raise after being dead or respawned for a specific time. (default off)
- Auto-raise can be configured to only work if the player possesses raise dead /
resurrection scrolls that are consumed in the process. If this is enabled then
the dying can never cause raise dead/resurrection scrolls to be dropped or destroyed. (default off)
- Additional force auto-raise timer for solo players only. (default off)
- Henchmen have their own separate auto-respawn and auto-raise timers.
- DMs can bring dead players back to life with no penalty by using a DM heal.

HENCHMEN BLEEDING AND DEATH:
- The same bleeding/death/respawn system can be used for henchmen by modifying
your henchmen OnDeath scripts. Requires two additional lines to your henchmen
scripts and should be compatible with all henchmen AI provided that they use the
NW_ASC_BUSY condition properly.
- Henchmen support does not require any other modifications.

PENALTIES:
- Separate % GP/XP penalties for respawn, raise dead and resurrection.
- XP penalty can be configured to prevent level loss (default no level loss).
- GP penalty can be configured to have a maximum amount to take (default 10,000gp max).
- If dropping/destruction of all gold is enable, then no gold will be lost to the
penalty (since the player drops the items before the penalty is applied).
- There is no penalty for henchmen bleed/death.
- User defined functions called at bleed, respawn, raise and rez that can be
used to apply other penalties without having to go deep into the internals of our code.

ITEM DROPPING ON DEATH:
- Item dropping on player death can be configured as any combination of the
following options. Any options can be configured to do nothing (0), drop item (1)
or destroy item (2). The conditions are evaluated in an order of precedence.
  - Drop nothing. (default)
  - Drop all gold. (this will avoid any GP penalties since gold is dropped before
  penalty applied)
  - Drop equipped left-hand/right-hand items.
  - Drop a random equipped item.
  - Drop the most expensive equipped item.
  - Drop all equipped items.
  - Drop Raise Dead / Resurrection scrolls.
  - Drop a random backpack item.
  - Drop the most expensive backpack item.
  - Drop all backpack items.
- Dropped items are NOT automatically re-equipped or picked up.
- If players forget to pick up items they dropped, they are automatically
reminded every 30 seconds.
- The placeable created to store dropped items is automatically destroyed when it empties.
- If all of the drop settings are disabled then the placeable is not created.
- There is an option to destroy dropped items rather than store them in a placeable.

PERSISTENCE:
- Persistence can be disabled with a flag. (default enabled)
- Persistence only works with a multiplayer server. It has no effect in single
player (no OnClientLeave event in single player). Exception: Using BindStones.
- Statistics to keep track of how many times the player has bled/died in total,
how many times since the server was restarted, and how much gold/XP the player
has lost in total from penalties.
- Persistent DB functions for storing bleed/death/respawn state.
- Auto-respawn and auto-raise timers are stored persistently at various increments.
- Players remain in the same state over module restarts, even with local vault
characters.
- Persistent data is stored with one DB write at OnClientLeave and one DB read
at OnClientEnter. It is very fast with minimal DB size (less than 1kb per player record).
- When bleed/death/respawn is restored at player log in, it does not reapply the
penalties or falsely increment the statistics.

RESPAWN:
- Can be used with other respawn systems (default uses our system)
- Option to disable death GUI to remove respawn. (Default GUI enabled)
- Option to disable respawn button but leave death GUI (Default respawn button enabled)
- Additional system to respawn as a ghost with no player control. (default enabled)
- Using bandages on respawned ghost makes them follow you if you are in the same
party (simulates carrying a corpse).
- Living players can barter with respawned ghosts (simulates search the players
corpse for scrolls, except corpse has a say in what is taken).
- Respawned ghosts cannot be DM moved by shift-click.
- Respawned ghosts cannot be recovered in single player by using the dm_heal console
command. So the respawn state could be used as permanent death in a single player
game by setting the auto-respawn timer to 0.1.
- Permadeath for PWs is supported (requires you to script what leads the player
to permadeath, see the custom permadeath function at script "habd_onpcrespawn";
furthermore you must specify a waypoint in the options there)
- Casting raise or rez brings respawn ghost back to life, but applies raise/rez
penalty on top of respawn penalty.
- DMs can bring the "ghosted" PC back to life by toggling invulnerability (no
penalty). Casting raise or rez also works, but DM heal does not.
- Respawned PCs can be moved to a waypoint or to a BindStone.

/* Remarks about timers:
When you set a timer like this:
AssignCommand(oPC, DelayCommand(fRespawn, ProcessToDo() )  );
Before patch 1.64 The timer runs with the PC.. until he lives the server or the
delay is finished. It means that, when the PC logs out, the delay process die
forever. It was a feature.
After patch 1.64 it doesnt happen... it means that the workaround for previous
patches can produce a bug, and some things are more difficult now. :(
To make HABD compatible with all versions we use a system that could cause a bug
(having two or more autoraising counters at the same time when login/logout)
but these counters will die if there are more process modyfing the counters ;)
Only the last Counter set will be valid.
